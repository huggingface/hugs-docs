# Docker

HUGS support deployment on Docker. You can run HUGS with default settings from a command line, or customize your configuration by creating your own docker-compose.yml file.

## Run HUGS with Docker

To run HUGS with Docker using default settings, run this command from from your shell:

```bash
export HUGS_CACHE=~/.cache/hugs
mkdir -p "$HUGS_CACHE"
docker run -it --rm \
    --gpus all \
    --shm-size=16GB \
    -v "$HUGS_CACHE:/tmp" \
    -p 8080:80 \
   'hfhugs/nvidia-google-gemma-2-9b-it'
```

<Tip>

The container URI might differ depending on the distribution and the model you are using.

</Tip>

The command sets the following default environment variables in the container:

- `HUGS_CACHE` defaults to `~/.cache/hugs`. This is the cache for the models, for faster loading next time.

## Sample Docker Compose file

You can also use a `docker-compose.yml` file to customize your configuration.

```
version: '3.8'

services:
  hugs:
    image: hfhugs/nvidia-google-gemma-2-9b-it
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    volumes:
      - ${HUGS_CACHE:-~/.cache/hugs}:/tmp
    environment:
      - HUGS_CACHE=/tmp
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: all
              capabilities: [gpu]
    shm_size: 16GB
    restart: on-failure:0

volumes:
  hugs_cache:

```

Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to suit your needs. You can add or remove environment variables, change the port mappings. To start your HUGS instance, run this command from your shell:

```bash
docker compose up
```
