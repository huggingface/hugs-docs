# HUGS on Kubernetes

HUGS (Hugging Face Generative AI Services) can be deployed on Kubernetes for scalable and manageable AI model inference. This guide will walk you through the process of deploying HUGS on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Requirements

- A Kubernetes Cluster (version 1.23 or later)
- Helm version v3 or higher

## HUGS Helm Chart

To install the HUGS chart on your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

### Verify tool setup and cluster access

```bash
# Check if helm is installed
helm version
# Make sure `kubectl` is configured correctly and you can access the cluster
kubectl get pods
```

### Get the Helm Chart

Add the HUGS helm repo and update it:

```bash
helm repo add hugs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hugs-helm-chart/main/charts/hugs
helm repo update hugs
```

Get the default `values.yaml` configuration file:

```bash
helm show values hugs/hugs > values.yaml
```

### Modify values.yaml

Edit the `values.yaml` file to customize the Helm chart for your environment. Here are some key sections you might want to modify:

#### Model Selection

Choose the HUGS model you want to deploy. For example, to deploy the Gemma 2 9B Instruct model:

```yaml
image:
  repository: hfhugs
  name: nvidia-google-gemma-2-9b-it
  tag: latest
```

> [!NOTE]
> The container URI might differ depending on the distribution and the model you are using.

#### Resource Limits

Adjust the resource limits based on your cluster's capabilities and the model's requirements. For example:

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1
  requests:
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1
```

### Deploy (install the Helm chart)

Deploy the HUGS Helm chart:

```bash
# Create a HUGS namespace
kubectl create namespace hugs

# Deploy
helm upgrade --install \
  "hugs" \
  hugs/hugs \
  --namespace "hugs" \
  --values ./values.yaml
```

## Running Inference

Once HUGS is deployed, you can run inference using the provided API. For detailed instructions, refer to [the inference guide](../guides/inference).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your HUGS deployment on Kubernetes, consider the following:

1. Check pod status: `kubectl get pods -n hugs`
2. View pod logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name> -n hugs`
3. Ensure your cluster has sufficient resources for the chosen model
4. Verify that the correct NVIDIA drivers and CUDA versions are installed on your nodes if using GPU acceleration

For more specific troubleshooting steps, consult the HUGS documentation or community forums.

## Updating and Upgrading

To update your HUGS deployment after the initial setup, modify your `values.yaml` file and run the `helm upgrade` command again:

```bash
helm upgrade hugs hugs/hugs --namespace hugs --values ./values.yaml
```

Always check the release notes for any breaking changes or specific upgrade instructions when moving to a new version of HUGS.

By following this guide, you should be able to successfully deploy HUGS on your Kubernetes cluster and start running inference with your chosen AI models.
